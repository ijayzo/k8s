# k8s
k8s. 3 nginx deployments with grafana/promethes, dashboards, rolling restart

please use https://github.com/ijayzo/terraformInstances as a guide to setting up and SSH'ing into instances using terraform (only difference is you need 3 instances here, and you will change the name on the aws console of the instances for ease of use) or you can manually create instances on the AWS console. Prefereable K8s instances should be bigger than T2/3.
